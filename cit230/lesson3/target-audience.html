                <h1>Target Audience</h1>
                <p>The target audience for this weather app is mainly for those in the college age. I would say around 17-30 would be the age.
                    Because around these ages jobs vary for students the average income made ranges from $7,500 to $42,000 a year. One thing that 
                    can be concluded with this age is that most people aim to save money and seek for the cheapest way possible. Education varies
                    from high school degrees to even some with college degrees. The experience for weather topics for this age of people is good. 
                    Everyone knows the basics to reading the weather on weather apps.
                </p>
                <p>The audience that I will be aiming for will be remote areas in Idaho. This weather app will have weather information for cities 
                    local to Rexburg, Idaho, a college town. College aged kids will most likely use the app everyday for seeing weather information 
                    for there walks to class. But, I think most the interaction will be weekends when they want to go out and have fun. This weather site 
                    will most likely be accessed on the phone for a quick look at what the weather will be.
