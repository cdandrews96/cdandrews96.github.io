            <h2>Book Share Non Profit Site</h2>
            
            <p>Book Share is a project I made on Wordpress to signify a fake non profit organization. 
                I made it to practice design and coding tactics on Wordpress to familiarize myself with the system.

            <p>Repetition is done well on the Little Ceasars site by its use of color. This color of orange used to show repetition for the site. As you scroll down the site the color orange is used in these big boxes for more appeal to each subject. It also makes you associate their company with this color orange.</p>

            <h2>Proximity</h2>
            <h3>Best Buy</h3>
            <h3><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/">bestbuy.com</a></h3>
            <img src="images/best-buy.png" alt="Best Buy Mobile Screenshot">
            <p>Proximity is about placing things together to show a relationship between elements and to show that they go along with each other. For the Best Buy website they use this principle by grouping different text elements together. The first group of text above the picture is a title, a description, and some links. They are all different elements but are grouped together with proximity to show that they are all related.</p>
