            <p>My target audience for Petal Weather is cyclists. They around the age of 18-40. It will be a nice designed site for cyclists 
                to see what is going on with the weather and news about the weather with cycling.

            <p>Jake is an architect. He is about 38. One of his hobbies is cycling. He does it to work out and likes to 
                go on big cross country trips with his friends. They do these trips every few months. They plan each trip with stuff they
